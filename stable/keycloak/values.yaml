# The list of keycloak groups that will be created by

# structure. In authors opinion, the yaml notation of
# long trees would be quite troublesome to create and maintain.
# The yaml reference feature is used to create a tree while group
# definitions are defined as a yaml list. The group creation mechanism
# iterates through the list and traverses each group and it's children,
# creating all the groups in the hierarchy. In order to mark which groups 
# are already a part of a tree hierarchy and should not be created again when
# a list iteration reaches them, the child flag is introduced.
